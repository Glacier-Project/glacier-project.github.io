        <h2>About the Glacier Project</h2>
        The Glacier Project is an effort to build a usable open-source mobile computing platform. Our goal is to create:
        <ul>
            <li>An open-hardware mobile phone, that can be assembled with readily available parts and tools</li>
            <li>A secure (but open) mobile operating system</li>
            <li>Web services (for GPS, IM, etc...) that respect the user's freedom and privacy</li>
        </ul>
        Two of these are already being worked on (see below).
